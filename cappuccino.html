		<h3>Origins and Cultural Significance</h3>
		Cappuccino coffee has its roots deeply embedded in Italian coffee culture, specifically in the city of Vienna during the 17th century. It was here that the concept of combining coffee with milk first emerged, paving the way for the creation of cappuccino as we know it today. The name "cappuccino" is believed to be inspired by the Capuchin friars, whose distinctive brown hooded robes resembled the color of the coffee mixed with milk.

		<h3>Components and Preparation</h3>
		The beauty of a cappuccino lies in its carefully balanced composition. A standard cappuccino consists of three equal parts: espresso, steamed milk, and frothed milk. The foundation of the cappuccino is a well-extracted shot of espresso, created by forcing hot water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans. This concentrated essence forms the base upon which the other components build.

To achieve the creamy and smooth texture, steamed milk is added to the espresso. Steaming creates microfoam, which enhances the mouthfeel and adds a delicate sweetness to the drink. The final touch is the velvety froth, achieved by introducing air into the milk during the steaming process. The froth floats atop the cappuccino, serving as a delightful visual and textural element.
